Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.

Return the answer with the smaller index first.

Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

Output: [0,1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 7, so we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10

Output: [0,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,5], target = 10

Output: [0,1]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 10,000,000
-10,000,000 <= target <= 10,000,000
Only one valid answer exists.
Most Optimised Solution - Use a Hashmap

class Solution:
  def TwoSum(self, nums : List[int], target : int) -> List[int]:
    hashmap={}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
      complement=target-nums[i]
      if complement in hashmap:
        return [i,hashmap[complement]]
      hashmap[nums[i]]=i
    return []

Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n).
We traverse the list containing n elements only once. Each lookup in the table costs only O(1) time.

Space complexity: O(n).
The extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the hash table, which stores at most n elements.
