Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, return true if it is height-balanced and false otherwise.

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4]

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,null,5]

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: root = []

Output: true
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
